						<strong>Eiichiro Oda</strong> (Japanese: 尾田 栄一郎, Hepburn: Oda
						Eiichirō, born January 1, 1975) is a Japanese manga artist and the
						creator of the series One Piece (1997-present). With more than 490
						million tankōbon copies in circulation worldwide, One Piece is both
						the best-selling manga in history and the best-selling comic series
						printed in volume, in turn making Oda one of the best-selling
						fiction authors. The series' popularity resulted in Oda being named
						one of the manga artists that changed the history of manga.
